            <p class="project_description"> <b>Project Description: </b>
            <p>This project is an attempt to re-create
                the popular web-game "Wordle", originally created by Josh Wardle.</p>
            <p>Upon each page refresh, a new word is loaded for the user to guess. The user has to guess the word
                in 6 tries. If the letter and its position is correct, the tile turns green. If that letter is
                present in the word, but isn't in the correct position, the tile turns yellow.

            <h2> Project Specifics</h2>

            <p> Things I Learned: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript's Fetch() function and how to deal with APIs and their data</li>
                <li>How to access the children nodes of a specific parent node</li>
                <li>How to iterate sequentialls over elements if they have the same
                    names with a numbered suffix </li>
                <li>How to change the focus of an element, in addition to autofocus</li>
                <li>The <i>onkeypress</i> event, and how to use it/place it where the user doesn't
                    need to select the specific field to write in</li>
                <li> Using an event listener for keydown events (and to prevent repeat, use keyup event
                    listener and a boolean to keep track if keydown event has occurred)
                </li>
                <li>How to change the colours shown for an element in focus and when active using CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Things I Enjoyed: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting the look to be as close as possible to the original source material</li>
                <li>Learning how to access child nodes</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Things I'd do Differently: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Start the project mobile-first, or look into responsive web design <i> before</i>
                    starting the project (in the planning phase)
                </li>
                <li>Be more like the actual Wordle game in which a new word is selected every day, not upon
                    every refresh
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Challenges that were Faced: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> How to make a responsive page
                </li>
                <li> Figuring out how to access only 1 row of input fields and editing
                    the properties of those fields, specific to that row
                </li>
                <li> How to access information from API calls, and how to use status codes to identify
                    if the result from the API call's response exists
                </li>
                <li>Preventing certain functions from bouncing</li>
                
            </ul>
