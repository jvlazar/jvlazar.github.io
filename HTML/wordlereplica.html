        <p class="project_description"> <b>Project Description: </b><p>This project is an attempt to re-create 
            the popular web-game "Wordle", originally created by Josh Wardle.</p>
            <p>Upon each page refresh, a new word is loaded for the user to guess. The user has to guess the word
                in 6 tries. If the letter and its position is correct, the tile turns green. If that letter is 
                present in the word, but isn't in the correct position, the tile turns yellow.

            <h2> Project Specifics</h2>
            
            <p> Things I Learned: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript's Fetch() function and how to deal with APIs and their data</li>
                    <li>How to access the children nodes of a specific parent node</li>
                    <li>How to iterate sequentialls over elements if they have the same 
                        names with a numbered suffix </li>
                  
                </ul>
            <p> Things I Enjoyed: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                  
                </ul>
            <p> Things I'd do Differently: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be more like the actual Wordle game in which a new word is selected every day, not upon 
                        every refresh
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Challenges that were Faced: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Figuring out how to access only 1 row of input fields and editing
                        the properties of those fields, specific to that row
                    </li>
                  
                
                </ul>
