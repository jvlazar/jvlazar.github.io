            <p> <b>Project Title: </b>Library System</p>
            <p> <b>Project Languages: </b>HTML, CSS, C#</p>
            <p> <b>Additional Tools Used: </b>Blazor</p>
            
            
            <p class="project_description"> <b>Project Description: </b> <p>This project was created for a university class
                (Human-Computer Interaction). This term-long project allowed us to design and implement a library system
                from scratch (from sketches to functional prototype).</p>
                 <p>
                    The user is able to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Login</li>
                        <li>Look up an item (book, dvd, cd, event)</li>
                        <li>Sign up for an event (for 1 or multiple seats)</li>
                        <li>Place an item on hold</li>
                        <li>Select pickup branch</li>
                        <li>Add item to wishlist</li>
                        <li>Remove item from wishlist</li>
                        <li>Renew item checked out</li>

            <h2> Project Specifics</h2>
            
            <p> Things I Learned: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic principles of C# (i.e. functions, variables, etc) </li>
                    <li>Learning the difference between the different "display" properties (i.e. flex vs. block)</li>
                    <li>Adding HTML elements depending on certain conditions using C# </li>
                    <li>How to have a handful of centralized file that will contain our user and item information 
                        that will allow other Razor pages and components access that information </li>
                        <ul>Solution:
                            <li>Injecting dependency</li>
                            <li>Adding singleton service </li>
                        </ul>
                   <li>How to pass information on a specific item to a Modal in a foreach loop (rather
                    than the modal only being passed the last item in the loop)
                   </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Things I Enjoyed: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning basic C# syntax and functionality </li>
                    <li>Designing the look of the website </li>
                    <li>Figuring out how to make the code as easy to understand (and access) as possible for other
                        group members
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating template layouts for an item page and learning how to change the details to 
                        be specific to that item (i.e. get the photo for that specific item)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Things I'd do Differently: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hook up an actual database to the system
                        <ul>Comment:
                            <li>We were told not to worry about creating an SQL database, or the like, and were
                                encouraged to hold our data in arrays/lists
                            </li>
                            <li>As a result, a lot of time was spent into trying to make our "database" accessbile
                                to all Razor pages and components
                            </li>
                            <li>The solution to this, as stated above, was to create services and to 
                                inject them into the files that needed them
                            </li>
                        </ul> </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Challenges that were Faced: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding how to user dependency injection </li>
        
                
                </ul>
