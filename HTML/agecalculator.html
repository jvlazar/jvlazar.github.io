        <h2> Project Specifics</h2>
        
        <p> Things I Learned: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic principles of JavaScript (i.e. functions, variables, etc) </li>
                <li>Learning the difference between the different "display" properties (i.e. flex vs. block)</li>
                <li>Adding HTML elements depending on certain conditions using JavaScript </li>
                <li>Changing HTML element properties with CSS through JavaScript</li>
                <li>How to add background images to buttons and work with .svg files</li>
            </ul>
        <p> Things I Enjoyed: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning basic JavasScript syntax and functionality </li>
                <li>Trying to get the visual look of the calculator to be as 
                    close to the original as possible </li>
            </ul>
        <p> Things I'd do Differently: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Before refactoring, I overcomplicated the calculations. Doing this again, 
                    I would first take a step back to properly thing over the math behind 
                    these calculations. Although they're technically simple, delving straight into it
                    without a plan resulted in overthinking the problem and constantly 
                    refactoring the code </li>
            </ul>
        <p> Challenges that were Faced: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing HTML elements based on certain conditions using JavaScript </li>
                <li>Figuring out the cleanest way to write code to calculate the values 
                    (and having to rewrite code multiple times as a result) </li>
            
            </ul>
