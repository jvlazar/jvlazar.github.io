        <p> <b>Project Title: </b>Mutation Inducer</p>
        <p> <b>Project Languages: </b>Python</p>
        
        <p class="project_description"> <b>Project Description: </b> <p>The goal of this small project was to automate
            a mutation in an amino acid sequence given the appropriate FASTA file, amino acid location, and the action 
            of deleting or changing the amino acid at that location.</p> <p>
                This script was created for an Intro to Bioinformatics class, in which our group project was looking
                to identify whether animals with the same mutation in a specific amino acid sequence would have the 
                same 3D structure characteristics as those in humans.

            <p> Things I Learned: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manipulating strings in Python</li>
                    <li>File handling in Python</li>
                </ul>
            <p> Things I Enjoyed: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Error-checking to ensure that the user knows whether there is that specific amino acid
                        at that location </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Things I'd do Differently: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Have all the code in one file. As it is, there's a separate file to delete and to substitute</li>
                    <li>Add the ability to insert an amino acid in the sequence</li>
                   
                </ul>
            <p> Challenges that were Faced: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Getting the script to ignore the header information of the FASTA file, and to start reading
                        at a certain location in the sequence
                    </li>
                
                </ul>
