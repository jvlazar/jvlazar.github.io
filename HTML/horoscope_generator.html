            <p> <b>Project Languages: </b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
            <p> <b>Additional Tools Used: </b>React, Node JS</p>
           
    
            <p class="project_description"> <b>Project Description: </b>
            <p>This project shows the daily horoscope for a given Western zodiac sign. 
            </p>
            <p>This project was done using React as the frontend library and Node JS/Express JS for backend code.
                Namely, the frontend was responsible for displaying the user's zodiac sign and the corresponding daily horoscope,
                while the backend was responsible for making API calls to get the horoscope.

            <h2> Project Specifics</h2>

            <p> Things I Learned: </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Basics of Node/Express JS 
                    <ul>
                       <li>How to set up a server</li>
                       <li>How to receive data from the frontend</li>
                       <li>How to send data to the frontend</li>
                       <li>How to use custom Node modules</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How to GET and POST data to/from APIs</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Things I Enjoyed: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning how to connect the frontend code (a React project) with the backend code</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Things I'd do Differently: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a different type of generator that had plenty of functional (and free) APIs available</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Challenges that were Faced: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Finding free APIs will give me the information I need
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Found an API gave me the daily horoscope for a given zodiac sign, but was only available in Portuguese
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Had to find a free API that would translate from a given language (in this case, Portuguese), to English
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Translator API had a limit to the amount of characters it can translate per day. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Resolved by making one large call to get all the zodiac signs' horoscope translated at once and save it for the day,
                                    rather than make an API call to translate every time a user selects their zodiac sign
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Getting the data sent to the frontend automatically once it's been calculated from the backend</li>
                </li>

                

            </ul>
